																Design Patterns

SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE

it means a class should not have more then one reason to Modify it. We should have seperate seperate classes for implementation.

OPEN CLOSED PRINCIPLE

It means that a class should be open for extention(Inheritance). And closed for Modifications.

example - suppose we have common properties in most of the classes then we can create a base class and fixed it means closed for modifications but we can extend it in other classes.

LISCOV PRINCIPLE

it say that we should not change the behaviour of the method in the base class.

example - class square extending the rectangle class violates liscove principle.

INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE

it says dont make large interfaces break them in parts bcoz if a class who implement this interface dont need all methods their it break the property.
